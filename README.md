This repository contains a project that i was working for half a year.

This was going to be a text adventure game working in terminal and using ncurses for graphical elements, got a lot of essential functionalities to work such as the terminal sizing regardless of the os (linux and windows) but i decided to change the whole framework and set a new course to this game project. I still want to set these source codes available for anyone whoever may find these helpful.
