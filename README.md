This repository contains a project that i was working for half a year.

I edited the code so that it could be used maybe as a good template for future projects

This was going to be a text adventure game working in terminal and using ncurses for graphical elements, got a lot of essential functionalities to work such as the terminal sizing regardless of the os (linux and windows) but i wanted to change the whole framework and set a new course to this game project. I still want to set these source codes available for anyone who may would want to use this freely as a foundation or some other ways might find this helpful. Or just completely copy the code and make it it's own game.
=======
This is going to be a text based adventure game. Pushing updates here.
